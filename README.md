# PFPJ03 - MLS league matches resume video generator
## Objective

The objective of this project is to generate a video related to a live web page using Selenium and Ffmpeg in Node.js. This is achieved by accomplishing the following sub-objectives:
1. Use Selenium as a web scraping tool. In this case, we extract information from a soccer league page.
2. Use Selenium to capture screenshots of specific elements.
3. Use Selenium as a web automation tool. In this example, we automate the creation of sound files on a sound generation page.
4. Use Selenium to handle shadow-root elements on the browser's download page and manipulate downloaded files.
5. Use Ffmpeg for video creation

This project's objective is not to generate high-quality videos but to explore the potential of Selenium and Ffmpeg for automatic video content generation.
In a project with the main objective of automatic video generation, I recommend using a Text-to-Speech (TTS) API, such as the ones provided by Google, Amazon, or Cooki TTS.
